## Introduction

LangProbe is a package that provides tools to calculate diversity measures for a given set of data. Specifically, it can compute measures like Shannon's entropy and Gini impurity. It also offers utilities to select prompts based on their diversity scores when interacting with models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo.

The primary goal of this project is to assist researchers and developers in analyzing the diversity of responses generated by language models, thereby aiding in the evaluation and fine-tuning of such models.

## Installation

```bash
pip install diversity-measures
```

## Quick Start

```python
from langprobe.models import OpenAIModel
from langprobe.measures import ShannonEntropyMeasure
from langprobe.utils import PromptSelection

# Initialize the OpenAI model and diversity measure
model = OpenAIModel(openai_api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY")
diversity_measure = ShannonEntropyMeasure()

# Use the PromptSelection utility
prompt_selection = PromptSelection(model=model, diversity_measure=diversity_measure)
selected_prompt, selected_diversity = prompt_selection.generate(["Your list of prompts here..."])

print("Selected Prompt:", selected_prompt)
print("Selected Diversity:", selected_diversity)
```
